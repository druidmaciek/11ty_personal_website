Jakub needed, a minimalistic and aesthetically pleasing website, that he could easliy add new content to (his painting, and photoshoots).
### Who is Jakub Kępka?
Jakub Kępka is a Warsaw based, artist and fashion designer.
### The Problem
Image heavy website that needed to be fast, aesthetically pleasing, and have an easy way for non technical user to add, update, and delete new content.
### Solution
I used JAMStack approach to develop the website, I created a static one page website with TailwindCSS, and used Svelte + SvelteKit to talk to the Storyblok CMS API, and populate the website with content. Whole website is easily deployed on Vercel.
