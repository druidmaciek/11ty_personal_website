CrowdEngage asked me to redesign and rebuild their SAAS application dashboard, and add a couple of new features. 

### What is CrowdEngage?

<span>CrowdEngage is a UK SAAS business, providing theatres with ability to communicate with their customers using SMS.</span>

### The Problem

The old dashboard was build with bootstrap, and looked like every other dashboard out there, furthermore it wasn't intuitive for the customers and wasn't mobile responsive.

### Rebuilding The Dashboard

I rebuild the dashboard using TailwindCSS, TailwindUI, and Alpine.js, ensuring the dashboard is beautiful, modern looking and easy to navigate, while being fully mobile responsive.

Additionally I designed the UI for the new features, and coded them in the Django backend.

After rolling out the new dashboard, and features, CrowdEngage founder, got a lot of messages from satisfied clients about the new dashboard, and short time required to add the requested features.
