Televisor needed a web application to help them streamline their business process, regarding adding and obtaining visual references for their projects.

### What is Televisor?

<span>Televisor is a leading Postproduction & Animation Studio in Poland, and they help to translate diverse visions and narratives into technologically advanced, unique and unforgettable images.</span><span></span>

### The Problem

Televisor needed a way to streamline a process of adding and retrieving various visual references by their employees for easier reuse across multiple projects, and to save employees times.

The previous solution involved manually saving screenshots, on a shared network drive of the company, so the process of finding old references was taking a long time, since employees had to look through many folders, relying only on basic file names to retrieve what they were looking for. 

### Saving References

To make saving references faster for employees, I created a Chrome browser extensions, that allows users to screen capture a portion of the browser screen, and upload the capture along with various tags, and link of current website to better describe the reference to Televisor's reference database.

### Finding References <span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>

To streamline the process of finding the references already added by the chrome extensions I designed and developed a web application that allowed users so search the references easily and filter them based on keywords and tags. Furthermore I created many features to make the process even easier:

*   Web application is secured by login, so only Televisor employees can access it
*   Users can collaborate by adding references to project boards
*   Users can create an unique link to share the project boards with their clients with out the need to give them access to the web app
*   Admin panel

Solutions designed and developed by me, helped saved countless hours the employees were wasting on finding the references, that can be now used on more creative work!
